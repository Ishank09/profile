        description: 'The paper include research about reducing human intervention in resource management and fault management by dynamic adjust protocol. Due to the constant rise in the number of programs running in the network and the types of devices linked to the network, keeping up with network management manually is nearly impossible. The paper used MLP-NN, SLP-NN, PIDNN, ANFIS, KNN, and other ml techniques for resource, fault management, and  QoS/QoE networking management. ',

        description: 'This study demonstrates the capability of Machine Learning models to forecast the number of upcoming patients affected by COVID-19. Used standard forecasting models, such as Linear Regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, Support Vector Machine, and Exponential Smoothing to forecast the threatening factors of COVID-19. The paper made Three types of predictions by each of the models, such as the number of newly infected cases, the number of deaths, and the number of recoveries in the next 10 days.Â ',
