    title: "Who I am",
    description1: "My name's Ishank. I'm a Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) student at the University of Washington. Previously  I worked at Dell and worked on a few tools as an architect and developer, which uses Python, SQL, MongoDB, Hadoop, Kubernetes, Elastic Search, .net, C++, GGPlot, Tableau, and Angular as key technologies. ",
    description2: "One of the projects at Dell was ‘Predictive analysis’ through which I used NLP and ML to predict the exact area of impact for a code when a change is made in an existing legacy piece of code in a 'Release cycle' across multiple applications. Creating a machine learning model and using natural language processing to find defects in automation was another project I worked on. My experience here has made me more adept at both following instructions and leading a team, which can be seen through my work as the Tech Lead on a CSR Project titled ‘Dbraille’, where I used my AI/ML learnings to convert a book into braille. Previous to my employment at dell I have built software projects as a part of a job or hobby. I have done a research internship in IIT, where I implemented a hardware trojan detection system, I worked for Zoho as an intern where I made a fault-tolerant system. Made an invoice system for a local grocery store while working in a company in Jaipur.",
    description3: "Even outside of work I love solving complex problems and coding. I recently started reading and have developed a keen interest in psychology. I enjoy travelling. Hiking, meeting new people, and cooking are some of my favourite activities. ",
