    description1: "Hi there! I'm Ishank, a skilled software engineer with experience in diverse technologies such as Java, Python, C#, SQL, MongoDB, Kubernetes, Elastic Search, .NET Core, Tableau, and Angular. My passion for technology led me to pursue a Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) from the University of Washington. With over three years of experience in the field, I am confident in my ability to develop and engineer top-notch software solutions that meet the needs of modern businesses. Let's work together to bring your ideas to life!",
    description2: "As a former software developer at Dell Technologies, I worked on an exciting and challenging project: the Automated ADO-plan generator. The tool allowed for the creation of ADO release plans based on specific segments, applications, and releases. Previously, POs had to create hundreds of suites manually, which was a time-consuming process. To solve this problem, I implemented a novel solution by automating the entire process and reducing time and manual efforts. One of the most complex aspects of this project was using parallel programming, calculating the total number of CPU cores, and using each core for multiple thread operations. I also used a tree with the breadth-first approach, concurrent bag, and queue for parallel operations on collections. Additionally, the TFS Suite creation API would fail when sending more than 2 or 3 APIs in parallel due to internal locking. To overcome this limitation, I implemented a retry mechanism with three retries on 1, 2, and 4 seconds. With extensive research and many challenges, I was able to complete the entire project within the deadline with an 80% reduction in time compared to the conventional method. In addition to this project, I have a diverse background building software projects as a part of a job or hobby. I implemented a hardware trojan detection system during my research internship at IIT and created a fault-tolerant system while working for Zoho as an intern. Additionally, I built an invoice system for a local grocery store while working at a company in Jaipur. I am always looking for new and exciting projects to work on and challenge myself to push the boundaries of what's possible in software engineering.",
    description3: "Even outside of work I love solving complex problems and coding. I recently started reading and have developed a keen interest in psychology. I enjoy travelling. Hiking, meeting new people, and cooking are some of my favourite activities. ",
